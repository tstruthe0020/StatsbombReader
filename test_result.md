# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

All endpoints include proper error handling for when analytics modules are not available. Ready for comprehensive testing of both success scenarios and error cases."

      message: "Advanced analytics endpoints testing completed successfully. All 5 new endpoints are working correctly: ✅ Zone Models Status (GET /api/analytics/zone-models/status) - returns proper status with availability, total models, zones analyzed, and diagnostics, ✅ Available Features (GET /api/analytics/available-features) - returns comprehensive playstyle and discipline feature descriptions, ✅ Team Match Features (GET /api/analytics/team-match-features/{match_id}) - extracts features for both teams in a match, tested with real match data (Deportivo Alavés vs Barcelona), ✅ Foul Prediction (POST /api/analytics/predict-fouls) - accepts team features payload and validates input correctly, ✅ Referee Slopes (GET /api/analytics/zone-models/referee-slopes/{feature}) - handles 'directness' feature as specified. All endpoints properly handle error cases: analytics modules unavailable (503), invalid inputs (400/422), invalid match IDs (500). Fixed GitHubAPIClient loader attribute issue. 25/26 total backend tests passed (only root endpoint returns HTML instead of JSON as expected). All existing endpoints continue working properly after integration."

      message: "CRITICAL ISSUE: New modular Referee-Discipline Analysis system cannot be tested due to compilation error. The system has been properly implemented with comprehensive architecture including feature flags, routing, tab integration, and TypeScript modules, but JSX syntax error prevents application loading. Error: 'Adjacent JSX elements must be wrapped in an enclosing tag' in App.js. Root cause: TypeScript files (.ts/.tsx) imported into JavaScript React app without proper TypeScript configuration. RECOMMENDATION: Either add TypeScript support to the project or convert TypeScript module files to JavaScript to resolve compilation issues. The modular structure and implementation appear correct but require configuration fix to enable testing."

      message: "REAL STATSBOMB DATA INTEGRATION TESTING COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY. Comprehensive verification of tactical analysis endpoint fix confirms all requirements met: ✅ Primary Match (3773386): Real team names 'Deportivo Alavés vs Barcelona' confirmed (not fallback names like 'Liverpool vs Manchester City'), real player names verified including 'Fernando Pacheco Flores', 'Joaquín Navarro Jiménez', 'Víctor Laguardia Cisneros', 'Norberto Murara Neto', 'Sergi Roberto Carnicer', 'Gerard Piqué Bernabéu' (not generic names like 'Barcelona Goalkeeper'), realistic tactical statistics with possession 21.3% vs 78.7% (totaling 100%), passes 238 vs 880, shots 4 vs 25, fouls 20 vs 6. ✅ Multiple Match IDs: All specified matches working - 3773565 (Granada vs Barcelona), 3773457 (Celta Vigo vs Barcelona) returning real team names and realistic statistics. ✅ Performance: Response time 0.28s (well under 10s requirement). ✅ Error Handling: Invalid match IDs gracefully handled with fallback data. ✅ Data Validation: Formations show actual numbers (4-3-3, 4-2-3-1), all statistics within realistic ranges. The Real StatsBomb Data Integration fix is working perfectly - no more generic fallback data, all real team names, real player names, and accurate tactical metrics being returned as expected."

## CURRENT STATUS - READY FOR TACTICAL ANALYSIS IMPLEMENTATION

### ✅ COMPLETED FEATURES:
1. **Real StatsBomb Data Integration**: Backend successfully loads real match data, lineups, formations, and statistics
2. **Match Viewer Interface**: Clean, focused interface with competition/season selection and match search
3. **Formation Graphics**: Visual formation display with all 11 players positioned correctly, enhanced name truncation, and support for multiple formations (4-3-3, 4-2-3-1, 3-5-2, 4-4-2, 3-4-3)
4. **Interactive Foul Map**: Color-coded fouls with hover tooltips, match-specific data, and dynamic team names
5. **Match Statistics**: Comprehensive team statistics with visual comparison bars
6. **Tactical Profile Placeholder**: Structure ready for tactical analysis integration

### 🎯 NEXT DEVELOPMENT PHASE: TACTICAL ANALYSIS
**Objective**: Implement comprehensive tactical analysis functionality to provide deep insights into team playstyles, formations effectiveness, and match patterns.

**Ready for Implementation**:
- Backend: Real StatsBomb data pipeline established and tested
- Frontend: Match Viewer foundation built with tactical profile section ready
- Data Flow: Match selection → Real data loading → Analysis display pipeline working
- Integration Points: TacticalProfile component prepared for data integration

**Architecture Status**: 
- ✅ FastAPI backend with StatsBomb integration
- ✅ React frontend with component structure
- ✅ Real match data flowing through tactical analysis endpoint
- ✅ Formation and player data correctly processed
- ✅ Statistical analysis foundation in place

**Performance Benchmarks**:
- Backend response time: 0.28s for tactical analysis
- Frontend rendering: Smooth with 11-player formations
- Data accuracy: Real StatsBomb player names and statistics
- Error handling: Graceful fallbacks implemented

### 📝 MINOR ISSUES TO ADDRESS LATER:
- Some edge cases in formation positioning for unusual formations
- Console debug logging can be removed in production
- Performance optimization for large datasets
