The AI engineer was tasked with integrating a **Referee–Playstyle–Discipline** analytics module into an existing React/FastAPI/MongoDB application. The work proceeded in distinct phases: initial exploration, backend implementation, initial frontend integration, and a subsequent, detailed frontend refactor.

Initially, the AI engineer set up the backend infrastructure, including new Python modules for data loading, feature engineering, discipline metrics, modeling, visualization, and CLI tools, as well as integrating new API endpoints into the existing FastAPI server. This phase concluded successfully after backend testing.

The first attempt at frontend integration involved creating a simple Referee-Playstyle Analysis tab. This was also successfully integrated and tested. However, the user then provided a comprehensive, detailed specification for a complete frontend module rebuild. The AI engineer embarked on this significant refactor, creating an elaborate modular structure, adding  for state management, and attempting to integrate it into . This process encountered JSX compilation errors, leading to the current state of a failed frontend test, indicating that the new modular frontend is not yet functional.

The overarching goal is to integrate a **Referee–Playstyle–Discipline** analytics module into a Python (FastAPI) and React application, leveraging **StatsBomb Open Data**. This module aims to quantify how team playstyles influence disciplinary outcomes (fouls, cards, foul location) by referee, incorporating a spatial (pitch zone) component.

**High-level outcomes:**
1.  **Reproducible pipeline** for per team–match features: playstyle predictors (pressing, possession, directness, width, transitions), disciplinary outcomes (foul counts, card counts, fouls by pitch zone), and referee metadata.
2.  **Zone-wise modeling layer** using Negative Binomial GLMs with  interactions.
3.  **Visualizations and programmatic interfaces** (CLI and optional REST endpoints) to render referee effect heatmaps, show per-referee slopes, and produce team-ref scouting summaries.

**Detailed Frontend Requirements (post-refactor request):**
A new, self-contained “Referee Discipline” analysis tab in the web app, mounted under , guarded by a feature flag (). This tab will visualize playstyle effects on discipline via:
*   **5×3 Foul Heatmaps:** Showing Actual, Predicted, and Delta vs. Baseline.
*   **Per-referee Slope Forest Plots:** For key playstyle features.
*   **What-If Panel:** Adjust playstyle features (SD deltas) and compare referees.
*   **Modular structure:**  with dedicated files for routing, state, hooks, components, and pages.
*   **Global filters and state:** Season, grid, game state, exposure, team/ref/match selection, and feature overrides (SD units), persisted in URL query params using .
*   **API contracts:** Specific GET/POST endpoints for baselines, matches, heatmap prediction, slopes, and report generation.
*   **Core components:** , , , , , , , , .
*   **Pages:** , , , , , , .
*   **Accessibility, performance, and testing** are critical.
