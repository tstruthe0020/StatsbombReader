The AI engineer successfully progressed the Referee–Playstyle–Discipline analytics module from initial setup to a nearly fully functional state. Key initial achievements included fixing frontend JSX compilation errors, resolving a  prop-casing runtime error, and integrating a basic Ref-Discipline tab. Significant effort was then directed towards establishing a robust data pipeline, addressing GitHub API authentication issues (revoked tokens,  dependency,  extraction logic), and successfully building a dataset of 274 team-match rows and fitting 15 zone models.

Frontend enhancements followed, enabling match, team, and referee selection, and implementing interactive Analyze buttons. A major addition was the Tactical Match Analysis section with expandable match cards. Challenges arose when the GitHub token expired, leading to fallback data usage. This was resolved, restoring dynamic competition and match loading. The current and final problem identified is that while competition and match loading is dynamic, the detailed tactical analysis still relies on realistic fallback data rather than actual StatsBomb lineups and formations, pointing to an ongoing issue in real data integration within the tactical analysis endpoint.

The goal is to integrate a Referee–Playstyle–Discipline analytics module into a React/FastAPI/MongoDB application using StatsBomb Open Data. This module quantifies how team playstyles influence disciplinary outcomes (fouls, cards, foul location) by referee, with a spatial component. Key outcomes include a reproducible pipeline for team–match features, zone-wise Negative Binomial GLMs, and visualizations (heatmaps, forest plots) via CLI and REST endpoints.

The detailed frontend requires a new Referee Discipline tab mounted under , guarded by a feature flag. This tab will feature 5×3 Foul Heatmaps (Actual, Predicted, Delta), Per-referee Slope Forest Plots, and a What-If Panel. It needs a modular structure,  for state management, global filters (season, grid, game state), specific API contracts for baselines, matches, heatmap prediction, and reports. Core components include , , , and various  and  components across pages like , , , and . The user explicitly requested expansion of the dataset and enabling selection of specific matches, teams, and referees, and detailed tactical match analysis.

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently addressing an issue where the tactical analysis section in the frontend is displaying realistic fallback data (e.g., generic player names, generated stats) instead of actual StatsBomb match data (real lineups, formations, and statistics).

Previously, the backend's  endpoint was generating this fallback data due to issues with the GitHub API token. The GitHub token issue has been resolved, and the  (which provides  and  methods) has been successfully initialized in the backend.

The AI engineer has begun integrating  into the tactical analysis endpoint to fetch real match data. However, a recent attempt to use this real data triggered a  error in the backend, indicating a problem in the fallback data generation logic, which might still be getting executed or interfering. The current focus is on debugging this backend error to ensure that the  successfully provides actual match-specific tactical data to the frontend.
